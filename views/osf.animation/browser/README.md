# OSF Animation — animation browser view

The in-game animation and scene browser/launcher. It is an HTML/CSS/JS view rendered by
**OSF UI** (Ultralight overlay) and driven **natively** by OSF Animation's own
DLL over OSF UI's bridge API (protocol **1.0**). Only JSON text crosses the
boundary.

## How it's wired

```
views/osf.animation/browser/ (this folder)  ──►  OSF UI  MessageBridge  ──►  OSF Animation DLL
   window.osfui.postMessage        (ui.command)              src/API/UIBridge.cpp
   window.osfui.onMessage      ◄── SendToWeb ────────────────  osf.animation.* handlers
```

- **Native side:** `src/API/UIBridge.{h,cpp}` (vendored bridge header
  `src/API/OSFUI_API.h`). Registered in `src/main.cpp` at `kPostDataLoad`
  (`OSF::API::InstallUIBridge()`), a no-op when OSF UI is absent.
- **Identity:** mod id `osf.animation`, view name `browser`, qualified view id
  `osf.animation/browser` — the id used by `RegisterView` / `RequestMenu`.
  The manifest declares `kind: "menu"` (focused, input-capturing) and an
  advisory `targetVersion` (the OSF UI version authored against; older hosts
  show a "needs update" badge on the Mods surface, nothing is gated).
- **Contract (`osf.animation.*`):**
  `catalog.get`→`catalog.data`, `library.get`→`library.data`,
  `pickCrosshair`→`pick`, `scanNearby`→`scanResults`,
  `anchorMatch`→`anchorMatch` (reply), `launch`→`launchResult`, `stop`,
  `wheel.set {sceneIds:[...]}` (persist the complete ordered emote-wheel loadout)
  or `wheel.set {reset:true}` (return to installed defaults); the reply is an
  unsolicited `catalog.data` re-push carrying fresh wheel state/order fields,
  `orbit {dx,dy,wheel}` (world-drag steers the native orbit camera; no reply),
  `opened`/`closed` (visibility reports off the `ui.visibility` relay), and
  `requestClose` (view asks the host to hide it — used by the emote wheel).
  Native→web `activeScenes {scenes:[{handle, sceneId, stage, player,
  cast:[{token,name,player}]}]}` is the authoritative live-scene list, pushed
  on `opened`, after a launch, and on every scene lifecycle change (stage
  advance, any termination — natural ends included). The view surfaces it as
  an **ACTIVE tab** in the browse mode switch (visible only while scenes run,
  labeled with the count) holding one card per scene — title, handle, YOU,
  current stage, full cast, per-scene stop (`stop {handle}`), STOP ALL —
  plus a compact header chip (a single scene shows directly with its stop;
  several collapse to a count) that opens the tab, and LIVE badges on busy
  crew. **Close semantics:** only scenes whose cast includes
  the *player* are aborted when the browser closes; NPC-only scenes keep
  running (vignettes/machinima) and resurface in this list on the next open.
  Native→web `mode {mode:"wheel", tagPrefix, target:{token,name}|null}`
  switches the view into **emote-wheel mode** (see below); any other `mode`
  restores the console. Flash-free wheel opens rely on OSF UI **queuing
  messages sent to a not-yet-visible view and delivering them before its
  first paint** (C ABI MINOR ≥ 2): the DLL pushes the mode before
  `RequestMenu(open)`.
- The view requires only that a bridge is present (`runtime.ready` arrives);
  it never gates on the protocol/version strings — the contract evolves
  additively. Platform pushes it consumes: `ui.visibility` (open/close relay,
  wheel-mode exit, orbit-drag reset) and `ui.error` (surfaced in the notice
  footer). Gamepad works through the runtime's default mapping (D-pad/left
  stick → arrows, A → Enter, B → close, right stick → scroll) feeding the
  view's directional-focus layer; no raw `ui.gamepad` handling.
- **Targeting:** crosshair pick (the target under the reticle when the browser
  *opened* — the engine nulls the reticle slot while any menu is up, so PICK
  resolves the open-time capture) *or* **Scan Nearby** — a cell walk that
  lists nearby actors (living, closest-first, with a species tag for creature
  filtering) and furniture with per-anchor scene counts, each as a clickable
  token. Scan rows draw a neutral silhouette (no portrait capture).
- Catalog = OSF Animation's **live** `SceneRegistry` (not a disk scan). The browser
  projects its runtime entries into player-facing kinds: ordinary authored entries stay
  under **Scenes**, while `presentation:"emote"` entries appear first under
  **Animations → Emotes** with quick-action language. They remain scene-backed internally.
  The view only ever holds opaque integer **tokens** (player = `-1`), which
  the DLL maps back to `RE::*` refs and re-validates on the main thread
  before use.
- **Library clean tier:** the LIBRARY lane defaults to poses & loopable clips
  only — stages tagged `transition`/`partial` (the vanilla dump's connective
  tissue) hide behind a "full library" banner toggle, and groups order
  photomode/pose sets first. The tier is bypassed while furniture is keyed
  (the anchor match already curates, and e.g. dance flavor clips are tagged
  `transition` upstream yet are the good content) and while searching (stage
  names are in the search hay — a hit must be visible). The brief mirrors it:
  library sets list clean stages first with the rest folded behind a
  "+ N transitions & layers" count.
- **Durations:** each stage card carries `loopSec` (clip loop length),
  `timerSec`/`loops` (stage timing), `openEnded` and `estSec`; each scene carries
  `estSec` (sum of stage estimates, holds counted as 2 loops), `estPartial`
  (some stage unmeasured — read "at least") and `openEnded`. All are `null`
  until the DLL's background clip probe has values
  (`Serialization/ClipDurations`, persisted in `<Documents>\My Games\Starfield\OSF\`);
  the DLL re-pushes `catalog.data` unsolicited when the scan lands, so the
  view must tolerate a second catalog push. The view renders `~2:30`, `+`, `∞`.

## Deployment (VFS merge — no copy in OSF UI)

OSF UI resolves its view dir relative to its own DLL
(`<DLL dir>\OSFUI\views\`), which under MO2 is the **virtual**
`Data\SFSE\Plugins\OSFUI\views\` — merged across all enabled mods. So this view
ships from OSF Animation's own mod folder; **no copy lives in the OSF UI repo or
mod**:

- `xmake` (`after_build`) deploys this folder to
  `MO2\mods\OSF Animation\SFSE\Plugins\OSFUI\views\osf.animation\browser\`
  (the two-level `views/<modId>/<viewName>/` layout OSF UI discovers).
- The DLL registers the view at runtime via `RegisterView("osf.animation/browser")`
  (C ABI 1.5) — the user's `config.json` is never edited. On an older OSF UI
  without `RegisterView`, the view only opens if the user lists it in `views`
  themselves (the DLL logs a warning).

Caveat: the merge relies on MO2's USVFS; a non-MO2 (real loose files) install
would need the folder placed next to `OSFUI.dll` manually.

## Settings / hotkeys

No drop-in `settings/osf.animation.json` file: the DLL registers the same
schema document at runtime (`RegisterSettingsSchema`, see
`src/API/UISettings.cpp`) — hotkeys (`hotkeys.openBrowser`,
`hotkeys.openWheel`, default unbound), interface toggles, and log level all
live in OSF UI's in-game settings menu under **OSF Animation**.

## Emote wheel (transient mode)

The `openWheel` hotkey verb (native `API::OpenWheel`) opens this same view in a
radial **wheel mode**: `osf.animation.mode {mode:"wheel", tagPrefix, target}`
hides the console/brief and rings up to 12 `wheelEligible` emotes; the ring's
ellipse is count-adaptive — near-circular for a handful, widening as it fills.
Before customization the ordered pool is derived from installed `wheelDefault`
emotes (the established `player.emote.*` tag remains a compatibility fallback),
so it works out of the box. The first **Add to Wheel**, removal, or reorder
materializes that whole default pool before applying the edit—customizing one
entry never makes every other default disappear. The explicit loadout persists
DLL-side in `<Documents>\My Games\Starfield\OSF\wheel-pins.json`, account-global,
surviving ReloadPacks and reinstalls. The selected emote's brief offers removal,
earlier/later ordering, and **Reset Defaults**. Wheel membership shows as ◆ in
the Emotes group. The hub names who plays—the crosshair target captured at open
time ("→ Sarah") or "You".
Arrows/hover step the ring, Enter/click launches (`osf.animation.launch` with
`castTokens:[token]`, no opts), success sends `osf.animation.requestClose`; a
launch error shows in the hub and the wheel stays open. Cancel = Esc,
right-click, or hub click. Exit is host-driven: the `ui.visibility` hide relay
clears wheel mode, so a later browser open always shows the normal console.

## Standalone dev

The page detects a missing bridge and runs standalone, so you can iterate
layout/logic in a normal browser. Serve it with
`python tools/view-dev-server.py [port]` (default 8791; also configured in
`.claude/launch.json`) and open `http://localhost:8791/`. For an in-game-true
render, open `http://localhost:8791/frame` — the view laid out at a fixed
**1600×900** (the overlay resolution) and stretched to fill the window with
independent X/Y scale, matching how the OSF UI harness maps the Ultralight
surface (`S` toggles stretch / 1:1 pixels; `?w=1920&h=1080` overrides the
size).

**Live data:** `live/{catalog,library}.json` are committed snapshot fixtures of
the payloads the DLL sends the in-game view, served as plain static files (the
page fetches `live/…` relative). The standalone page loads them instead of the
mock catalog — status reads `standalone · live snapshot`. `library.json` (the
vanilla-packs lane) is generated offline by
`python tools/generate-library-snapshot.py`, which replicates the DLL's
`BuildCatalog(library)` over `dist/OSF` — re-run it after regenerating packs.
`catalog.json` is a one-time in-game dump (the runtime mirror code has since
been removed; est times for hand-authored packs come from the in-game probe, so
refreshing it would need a temporary re-add of that dump or hand-editing).
Pick/scan/launch stay stubbed (they need live refs). With no snapshot (or when
opened via `file://`), it falls back to the built-in mock catalog. These
fixtures do NOT ship in-game — the xmake packaging copies an explicit file
list that excludes `live/`.

To exercise the **emote wheel** standalone: press `W` (mock crosshair target) or
`Shift+W` (player-only), or call `window.mockOpenWheel(withTarget)` from the
console; `?wheel` in the URL (`?wheel=solo` for no target, also on `/frame`)
boots straight into wheel mode so a plain reload keeps you there. The mock
catalog carries 14 `player.emote.*` quick actions so the hard 12-entry cap is exercised;
picking **Facepalm** mock-fails to exercise the error path, any other pick
"launches" and closes the wheel via the mocked `osf.animation.requestClose` →
`ui.visibility` hide round-trip.

**Backdrop:** in-game the page body is transparent over the live game world; a
desktop browser renders that as flat white/black, which lies about contrast. In
standalone mode a **dev backdrop** stands a fake world behind the overlay —
procedural scenes cycled with `B` (dark ship **interior** → bright **day**, the
readability worst case → **night** exterior → flat **none**), sticky per tab.
Drop a real screenshot at `live/backdrop.jpg` (git-ignored, never packaged) and
it joins the cycle as **shot** and becomes the default.

While the wheel is up, a **WHEEL DEBUG strip** (top-left, standalone only —
injected only when no bridge exists, so it can never surface in-game) drives
every wheel state without in-game round-trips: `−`/`+` step a generated emote
pool through wheelGeom's whole range (0 = the empty state, 1–3 = the tight
ring, past 12 proves the hard cap, and emotes cycle with numbered titles past 14);
`PINS×3` pins the first three emotes in *reverse* order to prove pin-order
sorting; `TARGET` flips the hub between "→ Sarah Morgan" and "You"; `ERROR`
plants a hub launch error; `LOADING` shows the catalog-pending state; `RESET`
returns to the real (snapshot/mock) catalog.

**Loadout standalone:** the `wheel.set` round-trip is mocked with a session-local
ordered loadout applied on top of whichever catalog is served. Remove or reorder
an emote from its brief, then `W`: the wheel retains all other defaults in the
chosen order. **Reset Defaults** drops the explicit list and derives the installed
defaults again.

## Aesthetic

Starfield "NASA-punk" maintenance-HUD, aligned to the shared **OSF design system**
(burnt amber `--accent` + brushed steel on a near-black void, teal HUD signal):
one framed **console** with amber corner brackets and a faint scan grid, a **slate**
header (cast / anchor / readiness + author toggle), three **bays** (READY NOW /
NEEDS ONE THING / LIBRARY) of spine-numbered scene cards with per-gate pips, and an
instrument **brief** module (registry id, requirements, seats, launch). Saira Semi
Condensed (Bahnschrift stand-in) for chrome, JetBrains Mono / Cascadia for data.
Restrained glows and gradients are intentional here — every glow signals state.

The design-system tokens are inlined into `style.css` (the view ships self-contained;
OSF UI serves no network, so webfonts fall back to Bahnschrift/Segoe). Source design:
